Romantical is an app for couples that measures the ‘romance’ in a relationship. Each partner is able to accrue points by doing something nice for their significant other. For example, you get points by making dinner or buying a present. Couples can earn points as well for doing things together such as bike rides or vacations. Points are then tracked for each partner, as well as the couple itself.



Romantical was started as an Epicodus class project, and is currently a work in progress.

Romantical was worked on over 2.5 days during week 8 of Epicodus. Team members included:
