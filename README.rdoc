Romantical is an app for couples that measures the ‘romance’ in a relationship. Each partner is able to accrue points by doing something nice for their significant other. For example, you get points by making dinner or buying a present. Couples can earn points as well for doing things together such as bike rides or vacations. Points are then tracked for each partner, as well as the couple itself.
